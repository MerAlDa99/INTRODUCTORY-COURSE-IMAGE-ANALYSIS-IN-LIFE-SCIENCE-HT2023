# INTRODUCTORY-COURSE-IMAGE-ANALYSIS-IN-LIFE-SCIENCE-HT2023
Code for the introductory course in image analysis. To run the imageJ macro, you need the cell atlas subset (which would be the input folder in the script). The results from running the macro can be found in the data.zip file, where each of the .xls files have been converted to .csv files and put in a separate folder for each sample. To run the python code, first download this data, and then make sure to be in the data as wd.
